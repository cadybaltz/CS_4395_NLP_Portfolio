The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge. We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in collecting and sharing knowledge that fully represents human diversity. Protect and sustain Wikipedia Donations are secure 1 You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That means you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just do not write your own bio, or copy/paste it into your homework.  2 We do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, donor privacy policy, and data retention guidelines. 3 Readers verify the facts. Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using reliable sources, so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but you and everyone you know can help. 4 The word “wiki” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia. 300,000+ editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month 90+ million media files on Wikimedia Commons and counting 1.7+ billion unique devices access Wikimedia projects every month We conduct our own research and partner with researchers worldwide to address change in society and technology. From site reliability to machine learning, our open-source technology makes Wikipedia faster, more reliable, and more accessible worldwide. We fight to protect everyone’s right to access free and open knowledge.  Our volunteers build tools, share photos, write articles, and are working to connect all the knowledge that exists. Free encyclopedia written in over 300 languages by volunteers around the world. The world’s largest free-to-use-library of illustrations, photos, drawings, videos and music. 

 It’s possible that right now, as you read these words, a WikiGap event is being held in a Swedish embassy somewhere in the world. Created through a joint effort from the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wikimedia Sverige, an independent Wikimedia movement affiliate organization in Sweden, WikiGap edit-a-thon events bring people together across countries…. If you were asked to name the greatest artists in history, who would come to mind?

 Throughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures. The internet has become the default for accessing information—women, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history. As a nonprofit, Wikipedia and our related free knowledge projects are powered primarily through donations.
